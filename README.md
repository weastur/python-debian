Build scripts to get deb-packaged latest Python which co-exists with system Python without interference.

## HowTo

Install docker and make. Then run

```shell
make
```

To issue build for a particular version

```shell
make python3.10-bullseye
make python3.10-buster
```

Look at the `build/` directory

## Internals

The build process runs inside docker, *without* using cache. It was tested on Linux and macOS.
The source code for building packages will be downloaded from the [deadsnakes](https://github.com/deadsnakes) project.
After the build, the simple smoke test takes place, installing all packages and running Python script.

## Contributing

You need an amd64 Linux host with Docker installed.
You can start from `.drone.yml` to inspect the build process.
The main files are `Dockerfile` and `Makefile`.

Also, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run some checks
locally before commit.

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## FAQ

### Which versions of Debian are supported?

All currently maintaied versions: 10 (buster), 11 (bullseye)

### Which versions of Python are supported?

Only latest version â€“ Python 3.10

### Why do not build all supported Python?

There is not much sense in that. If you need all Python versions for development, look at the
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) project or [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python).
In other cases, you can safely run old python code in the newest interpreter.

### How long does the full build process take?

Making the fastest build isn't a goal of this project.
