# Internals

The build process runs inside docker, *without* using cache. It was tested on Linux and macOS. The source code for building packages will be downloaded from the [deadsnakes](https://github.com/deadsnakes) project. After the build, the simple smoke test takes place, installing all packages and running Python script. 

# FAQ

### Which versions of Debian are supported?

All currently maintaied versions: 9 (stretch), 10 (buster), 11 (bullseye)

### Which versions of Python are supported?

Only latest version â€“ Python 3.10

### Why do not build all supported Python?

There is not much sense in that. If you need all Python versions for development, look at the [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) project or [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). In other cases, you can safely run old python code in the newest interpreter.

### How long does the full build process take?

Making the fastest build isn't a goal of this project.
